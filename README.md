> **[DE] Deutsche Version:** Für vollständige Anweisungen auf Deutsch, siehe [README.de.md](README.de.md)
> **[EN] English Version:** You are reading it!

Welcome to the refactoring exercise! This assignment reinforces the concepts from **Lecture 4: Refactoring - From Monolith to Modules**.

> **Note:** Error messages from automated checks (GitHub Actions workflows) appear in **both English and German**.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

1. **Apply the refactoring workflow** from Lecture 4 to transform monolithic code into modular components
2. **Use feature branch development** (Lecture 3 Part 1) with proper Git workflow
3. **Follow CI/CD practices** (Lecture 3 Part 2) with automated quality checks
4. **Practice incremental commits** showing step-by-step refactoring progression
5. **Participate in peer code review** to learn from each other

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

You will refactor the monolithic `src/road_profile_viewer/main.py` (390 lines) into four focused modules:

- `geometry.py` - Pure math functions (ray intersection calculations)
- `road.py` - Road profile generation
- `visualization.py` - Dash UI layer
- `main.py` - Simplified entry point (~20 lines)

**This is exactly what you learned in Lecture 4!** Follow the lecture step-by-step.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Clone Your Repository

```bash
# GitHub Classroom creates a repo for you - clone it
git clone https://github.com/hs-aalen-software-engineering/refactoring-YOUR-USERNAME.git
cd refactoring-YOUR-USERNAME
```

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Make sure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/refactor-to-modules

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
```

### Step 3: Extract Geometry Module

**Follow Lecture 4, Section 6.2**

1. Create `geometry.py` in the **src/road_profile_viewer/ directory** (same level as `src/road_profile_viewer/main.py`)
2. Copy `calculate_ray_line()` and `find_intersection()` from `src/road_profile_viewer/main.py`
3. Add proper imports: `import numpy as np`
4. Add type hints (see Lecture 4 example)
5. Test that it works (no errors when importing)

**Commit your progress:**

```bash
git add src/road_profile_viewer/geometry.py
git commit -m "Extract geometry functions to geometry.py

- Move calculate_ray_line() and find_intersection()
- Add type hints and docstrings
- Prepare for modular testing"
```

### Step 4: Extract Road Module

**Follow Lecture 4, Section 6.3**

1. Create `road.py` in the **src/road_profile_viewer/ directory**
2. Copy `generate_road_profile()` from `src/road_profile_viewer/main.py`
3. Add proper imports and docstrings

**Commit your progress:**

```bash
git add src/road_profile_viewer/road.py
git commit -m "Extract road generation to road.py

- Move generate_road_profile()
- Separate data generation from geometry and UI"
```

### Step 5: Extract Visualization Module

**Follow Lecture 4, Section 6.4**

1. Create `visualization.py` in the **src/road_profile_viewer/ directory**
2. Copy `create_dash_app()` and all UI code from `src/road_profile_viewer/main.py`
3. **Add imports using absolute imports:**
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import plotly.graph_objects as go
   from dash import Dash, Input, Output, dcc, html

   from road_profile_viewer.geometry import find_intersection
   from road_profile_viewer.road import generate_road_profile
   ```

   **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Use **absolute imports** (not relative imports with `.`) to avoid `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package` when running the module directly.

   **Why absolute imports?** When you run a Python file directly as a script, Python doesn't recognize it as part of a package, so relative imports (with `.`) fail. Absolute imports always work.

**Commit your progress:**

```bash
git add src/road_profile_viewer/visualization.py
git commit -m "Extract UI layer to visualization.py

- Move create_dash_app() and all Dash code
- Import from geometry and road modules using absolute imports
- Complete separation of concerns"
```

### Step 6: Simplify main.py

**Follow Lecture 4, Section 6.4 (end)**

1. The monolithic `main.py` already exists in `src/road_profile_viewer/`
2. Replace it with a simplified version (~20 lines):

```python
"""
Road Profile Viewer - Interactive 2D Visualization
===================================================
Main entry point for the road profile viewer application.

This application visualizes a road profile with camera ray intersection
using an interactive Dash interface.
"""

from road_profile_viewer.visualization import create_dash_app


def main():
    """
    Main function to run the Dash application.
    """
    app = create_dash_app()
    print("Starting Road Profile Viewer...")
    print("Open your browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8050/")
    print("Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.")
    app.run(debug=True)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Use **absolute imports** (`from road_profile_viewer.visualization`) instead of relative imports (`from .visualization`). This allows the module to be run directly with `python -m road_profile_viewer.main` or `uv run main.py` without import errors.

**Commit your progress:**

```bash
git add src/road_profile_viewer/main.py
git commit -m "Simplify main.py to entry point only

- Only imports from visualization module using absolute imports
- Acts as entry point (~20 lines)
- Completes refactoring to modular structure"
```

### Step 7: Run Local Checks

**Test everything works before pushing!**

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Test that the application runs without import errors
uv run python -m road_profile_viewer.main

# Stop the server with Ctrl+C, then run quality checks
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pyright

# If you see errors, fix them and commit the fixes
```

### Step 8: Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your feature branch
git push -u origin feature/refactor-to-modules

# Create PR using GitHub CLI (recommended)
gh pr create --title "Refactor: Split monolith into focused modules" \
  --body "Refactored src/road_profile_viewer/main.py into modular structure:

- geometry.py: Ray intersection math
- road.py: Road generation
- visualization.py: Dash UI
- main.py: Entry point (~20 lines)

All code quality checks pass.
Ready for review!"

# Or create PR manually on GitHub web interface
```

### Step 8.1: Enable Branch Protection (IMPORTANT!)

**⚠️ Before proceeding, protect your main branch to prevent accidental merges:**

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Branches** (in the left sidebar)
3. Under "Branch protection rules", click **Add rule**
4. Configure the rule:
   - **Branch name pattern**: `main`
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - In the search box, add these required checks:
     - `check-all-workflows` (Merge Ready Check)
     - `check-structure` (Structure Check)
     - `check-workflow` (Git Workflow Check)
     - `quality` (Code Quality Check)
     - `smoke-tests` (Smoke Tests)
     - `check-review` (Review Check)
   - ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
5. Click **Create** (scroll down)

**Why this matters:** Branch protection ensures you **cannot merge** until all automated checks pass. This prevents broken code from entering your main branch!

### Step 9: Wait for CI Checks

**GitHub Actions will automatically run:**

- ✅ Structure Check (verifies files exist, imports correct, etc.)
- ✅ Git Workflow Check (verifies feature branch, incremental commits)
- ✅ Code Quality Check (Ruff, Pyright)
- ✅ Smoke Tests (verifies basic functionality works)
- ✅ Review Check (verifies peer review process)
- ✅ Merge Ready Check (waits for all other checks to pass)

**Check the "Actions" tab on GitHub to see results.**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - DO NOT MERGE UNTIL ALL CHECKS PASS!**

The **Merge Ready Check** will monitor all other workflows and only turn green when:
- All structure checks pass
- All code quality checks pass
- All smoke tests pass
- Git workflow is correct
- You have received peer approval

**If you enabled branch protection (Step 8.1), GitHub will automatically prevent merging until all required checks pass.** This is a safety mechanism to ensure code quality!

If any checks fail, read the error messages, fix the issues, commit, and push again.

### Step 10: Get Peer Review

**Share your PR link with a classmate:**

```
Hey! Can you review my refactoring PR?
https://github.com/hs-aalen-software-engineering/refactoring-YOUR-USERNAME/pull/1
```

**As a reviewer, check:**

- [ ] PR is from `feature/refactor-to-modules` branch
- [ ] At least 3 incremental commits exist
- [ ] All 4 files exist (`geometry.py`, `road.py`, `visualization.py`, `main.py`)
- [ ] `main.py` is simplified (< 30 lines)
- [ ] Functions are in correct modules
- [ ] Imports flow correctly (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] All CI checks pass (green checkmarks)

**How to approve:**

1. Go to the PR
2. Click "Files changed" tab
3. Review the code
4. Click "Review changes" → "Approve" → "Submit review"

### Step 11: Merge Your PR

**Once you have:**
- ✅ All CI checks passing (especially **Merge Ready Check** shows ✅)
- ✅ Peer review approval
- ✅ No conflicts with main branch

**Verify the Merge Ready Check:**

The **Merge Ready Check** workflow will show you the status of all required workflows:
- If it shows "✅ READY TO MERGE!" - you're good to go!
- If it shows "⏳ NOT READY - Workflows Running" - wait for all checks to complete
- If it shows "❌ NOT READY TO MERGE" - fix failing checks first

**Merge your PR:**

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh pr merge --squash

# Or click "Merge pull request" on GitHub web interface
```

**Note:** If you enabled branch protection, GitHub will only allow merging when all required checks pass. The "Merge pull request" button will be disabled until then.

**Congratulations! You've completed the refactoring exercise! 🎉**

## 🛠️ Part 2: Build Your Own CI Pipeline

> **Reinforces Lecture 3 Part 2** (Sections 4.3.6, 5, 6.3, 11.3).
> These tasks are reviewed by your instructor during peer review — they are **not** auto-graded.
> Estimated time: **30–45 minutes**.

### Why this part exists

Until now you *consumed* CI: every workflow in `.github/workflows/` was written for you and you only had to make it go green. On a real team you also have to *author* CI. The three short tasks below have you write the kinds of GitHub Actions configuration files you will set up on day 1 of any new project.

You can do these as extra commits on the same `feature/refactor-to-modules` branch *before* you merge, or on a follow-up branch `feature/ci-pipeline` *after* the refactor PR is merged.

### Task 1 — Add a build-status badge to the README *(Lecture Sec. 11.3)*

Add a Markdown badge near the top of `README.md` that shows whether the `Code Quality` workflow is currently passing. Replace `<owner>` and `<repo>` with your repository's values:

```markdown
![Code Quality](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions/workflows/quality.yml/badge.svg)
```

**Self-check:** open your repository on GitHub — the badge should render as **green** (passing) or **red** (failing). On a fresh PR preview the image must not be broken.

**Commit:**

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add CI status badge to README"
```

### Task 2 — Enable Dependabot for GitHub Actions *(Lecture Sec. 4.3.6)*

When the actions you depend on (e.g. `actions/checkout@v4`, `astral-sh/setup-uv@v4`) release new versions, Dependabot can open pull requests automatically so you stay on supported, security-patched versions. Create a new file `.github/dependabot.yml` with the snippet from the lecture:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

**Self-check:** after pushing, navigate to **Insights → Dependency graph → Dependabot** in your repo. The configuration should appear there. (Dependabot may take up to 24 hours to perform its first scan.)

**Commit:**

```bash
git add .github/dependabot.yml
git commit -m "Enable Dependabot for GitHub Actions versions"
```

### Task 3 — Author your own quality workflow *(Lecture Sec. 5 + 6.3)*

Now write a workflow **from scratch**. Create `.github/workflows/student-quality.yml` that runs on every pull request to `main` and:

1. Checks out the repository (`actions/checkout@v4`)
2. Sets up `uv` (`astral-sh/setup-uv@v4`)
3. **Caches** the `~/.cache/uv` directory keyed on `hashFiles('**/uv.lock')` (`actions/cache@v4`)
4. Installs dependencies with `uv sync`
5. Runs each of these as separate, named steps:
   - `uv run ruff check .`
   - `uv run ruff format --check .`
   - `uv run pyright`

> ⚠️ Your workflow lives **alongside** the instructor's `quality.yml`. Do **not** delete or rename the instructor workflows — they still grade your refactor.

**Two ways to do this:**

- **Manual path** — open Lecture 3 Part 2, Section 5.1, and copy/adapt the YAML.
- **Copilot path** — open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I` in VS Code) and paste a prompt like:

  ```
  Create a GitHub Actions workflow at .github/workflows/student-quality.yml for a Python
  project that uses uv. It should trigger on pull requests to main, check out the code,
  set up uv with astral-sh/setup-uv@v4, cache ~/.cache/uv keyed on uv.lock, install with
  uv sync, then run ruff check, ruff format --check, and pyright as separate steps.
  ```

  Always **review** what Copilot generates: verify the action versions are current and that the cache step uses the correct path.

**Self-check:** open a PR and confirm a new check named `student-quality` (or whatever job ID you pick) appears in the PR's checks list, runs, and goes green.

**Commit:**

```bash
git add .github/workflows/student-quality.yml
git commit -m "Add student-authored code quality workflow"
```

### Submission

When all three tasks are committed and pushed, mention them in your PR description so the reviewer knows to look for them, e.g.:

```
Part 2 deliverables:
- README badge for the Code Quality workflow
- .github/dependabot.yml (weekly updates for github-actions)
- .github/workflows/student-quality.yml (PR-triggered quality pipeline)
```

Your peer reviewer (and the instructor during spot-check) will verify:

- ✅ The badge URL points at *your* repository's `quality.yml` workflow.
- ✅ `.github/dependabot.yml` exists and contains the `github-actions` ecosystem entry.
- ✅ `student-quality.yml` actually executed on the PR and went green.

## 🔍 How You're Graded

### Automated Checks (85 points)

GitHub Actions automatically verify:

| Check | Points | What's Verified |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Structure Check** | 35 | All files exist, functions in correct modules, imports correct |
| **Git Workflow** | 25 | Feature branch, 3+ commits, descriptive messages |
| **Code Quality** | 25 | Ruff, Pyright pass; no circular dependencies |

### Manual Check (15 points)

Instructor verifies:

- You received peer review approval
- The review was substantive (not just "LGTM")

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package"

This is the most common error! It occurs when using relative imports (`.module`) in files that are run directly as scripts.

**Problem:**
```python
# ❌ This fails when running main.py directly:
from .visualization import create_dash_app
from .geometry import find_intersection
```

**Solution:**
```python
# ✅ Use absolute imports instead:
from road_profile_viewer.visualization import create_dash_app
from road_profile_viewer.geometry import find_intersection
```

**Why?** Python only recognizes relative imports when a file is imported as part of a package. When you run a file directly (`python main.py` or `uv run main.py`), Python doesn't know it's part of a package.

**Apply this fix to:**
- `src/road_profile_viewer/main.py`: Import from `visualization` module
- `src/road_profile_viewer/visualization.py`: Import from `geometry` and `road` modules

**Verification:**
```bash
# This should work without errors:
uv run python -m road_profile_viewer.main
# You should see: "Starting Road Profile Viewer..."
```

### "Import errors when running locally"

Make sure you create all modules in the **src/road_profile_viewer/ directory**. This is the proper Python package structure!

```
✅ Correct structure:
road-profile-viewer-YOUR-USERNAME/
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── tests/
│   └── test_smoke.py
└── src/
    └── road_profile_viewer/       ← All modules go HERE
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── geometry.py            ← CREATE THIS
        ├── road.py                ← CREATE THIS
        ├── visualization.py       ← CREATE THIS
        └── main.py                ← SIMPLIFY THIS (originally 390 lines → ~20 lines)

❌ Wrong structure:
road-profile-viewer-YOUR-USERNAME/
├── geometry.py                    ← WRONG! Not in src/
├── road.py                        ← WRONG! Not in src/
└── src/
    └── road_profile_viewer/
        └── main.py
```

### "Ruff errors"

If you get Ruff errors, fix them! The monolithic `main.py` already follows PEP 8, but when you extract code you might introduce issues:

```python
# ❌ Common mistakes when extracting:
def generate_road_profile(num_points=100,x_max=80):  # Missing space after comma
    y=0.015 * x_norm**3 * x_max                      # Missing spaces around =
    return x,y                                        # Missing space after comma

# ✅ Correct:
def generate_road_profile(num_points=100, x_max=80):
    y = 0.015 * x_norm**3 * x_max
    return x, y
```

**Auto-fix most issues:**
```bash
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run ruff format .
```

### "Structure check fails: main.py too long"

Your `main.py` should be **~20 lines**, not 390! You should create a **new** `main.py` with just the entry point, not copy the entire original file.

The simplified `main.py` should only:
1. Import from `visualization` module
2. Define `main()` function
3. Have `if __name__ == "__main__":` block

Everything else goes to other modules!

### "Circular dependency detected"

Make sure dependencies flow in one direction:

```
✅ Correct:
main.py → visualization.py → geometry.py, road.py

❌ Wrong:
geometry.py → visualization.py → geometry.py (CIRCULAR!)
```

**Rule:** Lower-level modules (`geometry.py`, `road.py`) should NOT import from higher-level modules (`visualization.py`, `main.py`).

### "No peer review approval"

Ask a classmate! Share your PR link in the course chat or during class.

If you need help finding a reviewer, contact the instructor.

### "CI checks not running"

Make sure:
1. You created a PR (not just pushed to main)
2. The PR is from your feature branch to `main`
3. Check the "Actions" tab for errors
